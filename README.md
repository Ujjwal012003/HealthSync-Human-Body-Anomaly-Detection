# HealthSync AI - Human Body Anomaly Detection

A comprehensive web-based platform for medical anomaly detection that helps diagnose bone fractures and tuberculosis using machine learning.

## Project Overview

HealthSync AI is an advanced medical diagnostic tool that applies AI and machine learning to help healthcare professionals and patients detect health anomalies early. The system currently focuses on two primary use cases:

1. **Bone Fracture Detection**: Analysis of X-ray images to detect fractures
2. **Tuberculosis Detection**: Analysis of chest X-rays to identify signs of tuberculosis

## Who Can Use This System

- **Doctors**: Access to patient histories, ability to generate detailed reports, and collaborative features
- **Patients**: Self-service preliminary diagnosis, personal health tracking, and secure communication with healthcare providers
- **Healthcare Institutions**: Deployment options for institutional use with features for managing multiple practitioners

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Diagnostics**: Using XGBoost models trained on medical image data
- **Dual-Interface System**: Separate dashboards for doctors and patients
- **Secure Data Handling**: HTTPS support with SSL certificates for protecting sensitive medical data
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed diagnostic reports with confidence metrics
- **User Management**: Account creation, profile management, and role-based access control
- **Patient History Tracking**: Chronological record of diagnoses and treatments

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Flask**: Python web framework for creating the application server
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database operations and management
- **XGBoost**: Machine learning library for anomaly detection models
- **OpenCV & scikit-image**: Image processing libraries for feature extraction
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning utilities for model training and evaluation

### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core web technologies for the user interface
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **jQuery**: JavaScript library for DOM manipulation
- **Chart.js**: JavaScript charting library for data visualization
- **jsPDF**: Client-side PDF generation

### Security & Deployment
- **PyOpenSSL**: For generating SSL certificates
- **Werkzeug**: WSGI web application library with security features
- **Flask-Migrate**: Database migration management
- **Gunicorn**: WSGI HTTP server for production deployment

## Setup Instructions

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/human-body-anomaly-detection.git
   cd human-body-anomaly-detection
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   # On Windows
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   cd CancerDetectionWeb
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Initialize the database**:
   ```
   python drop_and_recreate_tables.py
   ```

5. **Validate setup**:
   ```
   python validate_setup.py
   ```

   ```
   python run.py
   ```

7. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to https://localhost:5000

## Usage Guide

### For Patients

1. **Create an account**: Sign up with your email and personal details
2. **Complete your profile**: Add relevant medical history
3. **Upload medical images**: Submit X-ray images for analysis
4. **View results**: Receive preliminary diagnostic results
5. **Share with doctor**: Send results to your healthcare provider
6. **Track history**: Monitor your diagnostic history over time

### For Doctors

1. **Create a doctor account**: Register with professional credentials
2. **View patient records**: Access patient histories and previous diagnoses
3. **Analyze images**: Review uploaded images and AI predictions
4. **Generate reports**: Create detailed diagnostic reports
5. **Communicate**: Send findings to patients securely
